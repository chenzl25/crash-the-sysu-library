# crash-the-sysu-library
>this js can be used to find the account of SYSU students in the library voilently,
if they haven't change their initial password.

**how to use ? so easy. open your terminal, if your have installed the node.js**

1. npm install
2. node crash.js id password

###attention
1. the id maybe something like 14331001, which is the student's id in sysu_
2. the password maybe 100000, remember the password should be 6 digits and be close to the last of 6 digits of the id card of the student you want to crash
3. you can narrow down the scope by the QQ information.

**the password is where the possible password begin,**
**the js will run it by password++ (I setup 10000 times)**
