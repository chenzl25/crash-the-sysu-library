# crash-the-sysu-library
>this js can be used to find the account of SYSU students in the library voilently,
if they haven't change their initial password.

**how to use ? so easy. open your terminal, if your have installed the node.js**

1. npm install
2. node crash.js id password

**the id maybe 14331001**

**the password is where the possible password begin,**
**the js will run it by password++ (I setup 10000 times)**
